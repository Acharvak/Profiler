## References
The profiler has originally been written by Uli Reffle as part of his PhD thesis in computational linguistics at CIS during the IMPACT project (2008-2011). 

It has been further developed as a CLARIN-D Kurationsprojekt by Florian Fink at CIS.

Its underlying technology is described in the following publications:
